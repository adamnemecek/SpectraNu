Spectra

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/FYL0pBuF/spectra) if you want to
contribute or see what i'm working on

**N.B.** -> this library will be moved to replace dcunited001/Spectra at
some point. Soooo, actually using it is not recommended yet

rewriting this library for like the fifth time, since cocoapods is broken.
